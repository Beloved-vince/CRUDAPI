            DEBUG=True
            SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
            DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
            Migrate the database:

        2. python manage.py migrate

Access the Django admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin/ and log in with the superuser account you created in step 3.
